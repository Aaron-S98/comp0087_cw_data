Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the Barbados Travel Protocols. If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated. A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly."

You will need to remain in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. The government aims to return results within 48 hours, although return times can sometimes be longer than this. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine."

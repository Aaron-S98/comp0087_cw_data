All scheduled international commercial flights and rail are suspended. All road border crossings to and from Russia are closed to foreign nationals. Borders between China and Mongolia are closed. All passengers arriving in Mongolia are required to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure from their first embarkation point.On arrival, incoming passengers are advised to self-isolate at home for 3 days. We understand that the authorities may also require passengers to take and pay for an additional PCR test at Chinggis Khan International Airport, although implementation of this is inconsistent. We will update this advice if this requirement changes. "

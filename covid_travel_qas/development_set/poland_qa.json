If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. You might find some offices are only open by appointment or have restrictions on in-person attendance and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited."

Those who test negative after the second test will be free to leave quarantine. Those who test positive will be required to isolate immediately. Oil company employees will be able to isolate in oil company isolation facilities, whilst other individuals will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Equatorial Guinea has nominated for isolation until a negative test is returned. This applies to all, including those under 18. Authorities may withdraw passports from passengers if an invalid PCR test is presented. You should arrange to take a private test."

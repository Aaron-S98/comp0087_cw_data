(This reduction from the previous 10-day requirement also applies to travellers who had already commenced their period of quarantine and self-isolation at the time of the announcement). For those coming from the UK, the first 6 days must be spent in quarantine in a government-provided hotel. You will need to take a COVID-19 test on days 3 and 6 (the day of arrival counts as Day 0). If the tests are negative, you will be permitted to move into self-isolation at home or in a self-arranged hotel for the remainder of the 7-day period."

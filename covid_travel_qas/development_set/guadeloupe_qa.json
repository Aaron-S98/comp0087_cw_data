The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking. Travellers must also provide a self -certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days. Airlines will refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document.

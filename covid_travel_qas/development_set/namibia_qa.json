From 15 November, Namibia commenced use of the Trusted Travel Platform to verify COVID-19 tests taken before travel to Namibia. From 15 January 2022, only test results obtained from the Trusted Travel Platform or verified on the Global Haven system will be valid for entry into Namibia. Any person entering Namibia must present proof on arrival in Namibia of a negative COVID-19 test taken in the country of departure. The test result must not be older than 72 hours (calculated from the time that the sample for testing was taken) at the time of entry into Namibia. This requirement also applies to anyone who has been vaccinated against COVID-19, a negative test must still be produced before entry into the country. Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Test results are not accepted for entry into Namibia. In addition, random PCR tests will be conducted on those entering Namibia. Permanent residents do not need to provide a negative test on arrival but if they do not, they will be required to pay for and undertake a PCR test on arrival, and be required to quarantine at their own cost until a negative result has been produced. You should check with your airline for any regulations they might have for a negative test result in order to travel. You should arrange to take a private test. "

You should not eat anything 30 minutes before your arrival at the entry point. You will have to pay for the test either by credit card, but as the credit card machines do not always work, cash (dollars, euros accepted) is a more reliable method of payment. If the test result is positive, foreign travellers will have to go into quarantine, at their own expense, at a hotel agreed with those conducting the test or if showing symptoms into the hospital, until testing negative. Djiboutian nationals who test positive can choose to go to a government isolation site at no cost or pay costs of staying at a hotel."

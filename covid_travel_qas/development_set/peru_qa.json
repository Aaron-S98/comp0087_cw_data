All passengers to Peru of 12 years old or more whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination received either in Peru or abroad or a negative COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued a maximum of 48 hours before the flight departs. Those under 12 years old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. These rules are subject to change at short notice. You should arrange to take a private test. Land borders for international passenger transit remain closed for foreign nationals and non-residents in Peru. If you want to enter or leave Peru by land from any of these countries, you must request a special permit from the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in some cases to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of your country of origin/destination. This may change at short notice, so you should check what restrictions are in place before you plan a trip to Peru by land."

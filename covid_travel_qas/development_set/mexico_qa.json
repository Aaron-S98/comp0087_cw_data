The closure will still be in effect for non-vaccinated travellers and applies primarily to tourism and recreational travel. Cargo, trade and healthcare workers will still be able to cross the border. Check with your closest US Embassy/Consulate before attempting to cross the border. If you present symptoms of COVID-19 upon arrival at an airport in Mexico, you should ask for the International Health Team (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sanidad Internacional\u00e2\u20ac\u009d). Upon your arrival in Mexico, you will be asked to fill out a Health Questionnaire. This document is available in Spanish and English"

Zambian Government guidelines are that all travellers to Zambia must produce evidence of a PCR COVID-19 negative test taken within 72 hours of departure from country of origin. Some airlines are asking passengers for evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Zambia. You should check your airline guidelines on testing carefully when arranging your tests. Under-fives are exempt from this requirement. Travellers to Zambia are encouraged to be fully vaccinated but this is not mandatory. You should arrange to take a private test. All airports are open to flights, though availability of international flights remains limited."

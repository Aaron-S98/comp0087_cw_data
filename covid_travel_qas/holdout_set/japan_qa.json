Alternatively, if you do not wish to take a Day 3 COVID-19 test, you may opt to spend 7 full days in self-isolation. Please note that you must have received two doses of the vaccine plus a booster shot at least 14 days prior to travel in order to be considered fully vaccinated. If you\u2019ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above. Children and young people: Minors are not exempt from the testing requirements on age grounds. There may be some flexibility on pre-flight testing requirements for children aged 5 and under, but this cannot be guaranteed. For children who are not eligible for vaccines or a booster, provided they are accompanied by a fully-vaccinated parent (who has received their booster shot) who supervises their activities, they may follow the same rules as their parent."

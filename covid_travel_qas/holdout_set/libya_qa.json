Anyone arriving in Benghazi as well as other areas in eastern Libya will need to have a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate issued within the last 48 hours prior to their arrival. Travellers departing from Libya must have a PCR test carried out within 20 hours before flight. On arrival, travellers will undergo PCR testing and must quarantine for three days until the result is received. Travellers with a positive result will be transferred to a designated centre for further treatment, and those with a negative result will be subject to home quarantine for ten days."

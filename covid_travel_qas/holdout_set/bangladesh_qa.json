Passengers with COVID-19 symptoms may be required to take a PCR test. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at a government authorised facility for at least seven days and until they test negative in a subsequent PCR test. In all circumstances, people staying in a government approved hotel, government facility or hospital will need to cover the costs of those stays and any necessary COVID-19 tests.

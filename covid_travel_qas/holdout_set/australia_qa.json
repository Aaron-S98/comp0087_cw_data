Exemption applications can be submitted online on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website. You should check the steps you should take to prepare to travel to Australia from overseas. A negative COVID-19 test is required for travelling to Australia. This can be in the form of evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 3 days of scheduled departure, or evidence of a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken under medical supervision within 24 hours before scheduled departure. If your flight is delayed, you will be considered to meet pre-testing requirements. If your flight is rescheduled or cancelled, you may need to take another COVID-19 test. If you are a fully vaccinated traveller, you will be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination. If you were vaccinated outside of Australia, you can check the requirements for foreign vaccine certificates."

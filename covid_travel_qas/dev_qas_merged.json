This means that travelers will need to have been in New Zealand for 14 consecutive days prior to departure, before quarantine-free travel to the Cook Islands. Entry rules in response to coronavirus : The borders of the Cook Islands are closed to all persons unless an exemption is provided by the Cook Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration. The closure is in response to new cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand."

Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do."

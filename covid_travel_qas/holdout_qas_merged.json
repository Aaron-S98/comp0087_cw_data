Additionally, CDC is updating the recommended quarantine period for those exposed to COVID-19. For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than two months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days. Alternatively, if a five-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure."

Some airlines are asking passengers for evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Zambia. You should check your airline guidelines on testing carefully when arranging your tests. Under-fives are exempt from this requirement. Travellers to Zambia are encouraged to be fully vaccinated but this is not mandatory. You should arrange to take a private test.

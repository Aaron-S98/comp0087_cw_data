Passengers travelling from a non-EU country to another non-EU country may transit through the international transit area of airports located in the Schengen area. Rules regarding airport transit visa requirements continue to apply. Additionally, for the Czech Republic, land transit is allowed up to 12 hours without any restrictions."
